    <abstract>
      <para>
  The ARPA-E funded TERRA REF project generating open access reference
  datasets for the study of plant sensing, genomics, and phenomics.
  Sensor data are generated by a field scanner sensing platform that
  captures color, thermal, hyperspectral, and active flourescence
  imagery as well as three dimensional structure and associated
  environmental measurements. These data are provided alongside
  traditional field methods to support calibration and validation of
  algorithms used to extract plot level phenotypes from these datasets.
</para>
      <para>
  Data were collected at a field site in Maricopa, AZ that hosts a large
  field scanner with fifteen sensors, many of which are capable of
  capturing mm scale images and point clouds at daily to weekly
  intervals.
</para>
      <para>
  These data are intended to be reused, and are accessible as a
  combination of files and databases linked by spatial, temporal, and
  genomic information. In addition to providing open access data, the
  entire computational pipeline is open source, and we enable users to
  access high performance computing environments.

      <para>
  The study has evaluated a sorghum diversity panel, biparental cross
  populations, and elite lines and hybrids from structured breeding
  populations as well as a durum wheat diversity panel. This reference
  dataset can be used to characterize phenotype-to-genotype
  associations, on a genomic scale, that will enable knowledge-driven
  breeding and the development of higher-yielding cultivars of sorghum
  and wheat. The data is also being used to develop new algorithms for
  machine learning, image analysis, genomics, and optical sensor
  engineering.

  infrared radiometer (IRT), and canopy height using a sonar proximity
  sensor. The front-boom sensor array included three replicate sets of

          </para>
          <para>Plant biomass was sampled from 1 meter
  of row on 8 June 2016 and 29 June 2016. Stems were cut by hand near
  the soil surface and placed in a plastic bag for processing. The
  number of plants in the sample and canopy height were recorded in the
  field. The samples were then taken into the lab for processing. The
  number of main stems and tillers in the entire sample were counted.
  The entire sample was used on the 8 June 2016 sampling date and a
  subsample of 5 plants on the 29 June 2016 sampling date for further
  processing. This 5-plant subsample (June 29) was weighed as well as
  the entire sample. The leaves were then separated from the stems for
  leaf area measurements. The fresh weight of the leaves and stems were
  measured for the 29 June 2016 sampling date. Leaf area was measured
  using a LiCor area meter and leaf area index (LAI) calculated by
  dividing leaf area by land area of the sample measured. The land area
  representative of the leaf area measured was 0.762 m2 for the 8 June
  2016 sampling date and 0.762 m2 times the subsample fraction for the
  29 June 2016 sampling date. The subsample fraction is defined as the
  weight of the subsample divided by the weight of the total sample. The
  leaves and stems were then placed in an oven and dried at 65 C, and
  dry weight was measured after the plant material was dry. The biomass
  of the stems and leaves on a dry weight basis were calculated from the
  measured dry weight divided by the land area representative of the
  processed sample for each sampling date as discussed above for leaf
  area. Specific leaf area (for both sample dates) and dry matter
  fraction (for the June 29 sample date) were also calculated.

          </para>
          <para>Repeat
  measurements were taken using hand-held instruments to estimate leaf
  surface temperatures and leaf stomatal conductance within 6-8 select
  plots (3-4 accessions x 2 replicates) on 7 dates in mid to late June
  2017 (sorghum season 4) as part of a focused field phenotyping
  campaign related to stomatal regulation. Leaf surface temperatures
  were estimated using a FLIR TG167 Spot Thermal Camera
  (http://www.flir.com/instruments/tg167/) and an Apogee Infrared
  Radiometer Model MI-230
  (https://www.apogeeinstruments.com/ultra-narrow-field-of-view-infrared-radiometer-with-handheld-meter-mi-230/).
  Measurements were taken on sunlit leaves, targeting fully expanded
  when possible, at a distance of approximately 20 to 40 cm above the
  leaf surface. Within each plot and at each measurement time, 6 total
  measurements were taken using the FLIR and Apogee instruments, with 3
  measurements taken in each of the West and East subplot rows. Leaf
  stomatal conductance was measured using a Decagon SC-1 Porometer
  (https://www.decagon.com/en/canopy/canopy-measurements/sc-1-leaf-porometer-stomatal-conductance-measurements/).
  Within each plot and at each measurement time, 5 total measurements
  were taken using the porometer, on sunlit leaves targeting fully
  expanded leaves when possible. On each of the 7 dates when
  measurements were taken, early morning baseline equilibrium readings
  starting at 5:45 to 6:00 for one cycle through all 8 plots. Mid-day
  readings started at roughly 11:00 and continued through 3 repeat
  cycles of the 6-8 plots until roughly 15:00 to 16:00. The porometer
  was calibrated at least once in the early morning and again before the
  mid-day readings. The FLIR TG167 spot camera was tested against a
  thermal blackbody unit on 2017-06-21 (recorded 5 readings at 34.5 to
  34.6 C while the thermal blackbody recorded 33.9 C). During the later
  measurement dates, 2 plots were dropped from the repeat measurement
  cycles because they had grown out of reach for hand measurements.

  (https://photosynq.org/protocols/leaf-photosynthesis-multispeq-v1-0)
  Measurements made during August 2017 in the BAP experiment required a
  ladder to access leaves in the upper canopy. Repeat measurements were
  taken on select plots between approximately 10:30 and 14:30, typically
  cycling through 8 plots (4 accessions x 2 reps) several times to
  establish a time series of the parameters centered around solar noon.
  At each sampling time for each plot, 6 subsample measurements were
  taken within the plot. During August 2017 irrigation treatments were
  implemented at two levels (water-deficit zones with no irrigation and
  well-watered zones irrigated for optimal plant water status). Plots
  were selected for measurements within each of the two irrigation
  treatments. </para>
