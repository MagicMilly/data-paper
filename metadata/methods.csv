Maricopa Phenotractor,"An array of three types of senors mounted on the front boom of a tractor were used to collect multi-spectral, thermal, and height data from the field.  Each set of sensors collected data from a single row of plants.  Canopy reflectance was measured using a GreenSeeker (RT200 System by Trimble) sensor, canopy surface temperature using an Apogee S1-121 infrared radiometer (IRT), and canopy height using a sonar proximity sensor.  The front-boom sensor array included three replicate sets of sensors in 2016 to allow three rows of plants to be measured during each single tractor pass.  Data analyses for four dates (25 Aug, 1 Sept, 8 Sept, and 23 Sept) were completed by Matthew Maimaitiyiming and Wasit Wulamu, as described in their document included here.

Center for Sustainability, Saint Louis University
January 6, 2017

The phenotractor was equipped with three types of sensors for measuring plant height, temperature and canopy spectral reflectance.  A RTK GPS was installed on top of the tractor, see the figure 1.
 
Figure 1. Phenotractor system configuration
The distance from canopy to sensor position was measured with a sonar proximity sensor (Soutput, in mm).  Canopy height (CH) was determined by combining sonar and GPS elevation data (expressed as meter above sea level).  An elevation survey was conducted to determine a baseline reference elevation (Eref) for the gantry field.  CH was computed according to the following equation: 
CH = Es – Eref - Soutput
where  Es is sensor elevation, which was calculated by subtracting the vertical offset between the GPS antenna and sonar sensor from GPS antenna elevation.
Infrared radiometer (IRT) sensors were used measure canopy temperature and temperature values were recoded as degree Celsius (°C).   
Canopy spectral reflectance was measured with GreenSeeker sensors and the reflectance data were used to calculate NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).  GreenSeeker sensors record reflected light energy in near infrared (780 ± 15 nm) and red (660 ± 10 nm ) portion electromagnetic spectrum from top of the canopy by using a self-illuminated light source. NDVI was calculated using following equation: 
NDVI=(ρ_NIR-ρ_red)/(ρ_NIR+ ρ_red )
Where ρ_NIR and ρ_red represent fraction of reflected energy in near infrared and red spectral regions, respectively.  
Georeferencing 
Georefencing was carried out using Quantum GIS (GGIS, www.qgis.org ) plug-in by Andrade-Sanchez et al. (2014) during post processing. Latitude and longitude coordinates were converted to UTM coordinate system.  Offset from the sensors to the GPS position on the tractor heading were computed and corrected.  Next, the tractor data, which uses UTM Zone 12 (MAC coordinates), was transformed to EPSG:4326 (WGS84) USDA coordinates by performing  a linear shifting as follows:   
Latitude: Uy = My – 0.000015258894
Longitude: Ux = Mx + 0.000020308287 
where Uy and Ux are latitude and longitude in USDA coordinate system, and My and Mx are latitude and longitude in MAC coordinate system.
Finally, georeferenced tractor data was overlaid on the gantry field polygon and mean value for each plot/genotype was calculated using the data points that fall inside the plot polygon within ArcGIS Version 10.2 (ESRI. Redlands, CA).

In-season leaf area and biomass estimates by destructive sampling,"Plant biomass was sampled from 1 meter of row on 8 June 2016 and 29 June 2016.  Stems were cut by hand near the soil surface and placed in a plastic bag for processing.  The number of plants in the sample and canopy height were recorded in the field.  The samples were then taken into the lab for processing.  The number of main stems and tillers in the entire sample were counted.  The entire sample was used on the 8 June 2016 sampling date and a subsample of 5 plants on the 29 June 2016 sampling date for further processing.  This 5-plant subsample (June 29) was weighed as well as the entire sample.  The leaves were then separated from the stems for leaf area measurements.  The fresh weight of the leaves and stems were measured for the 29 June 2016 sampling date.  Leaf area was measured using a LiCor  area meter and leaf area index (LAI) calculated by dividing leaf area by land area of the sample measured.  The land area representative of the leaf area measured was 0.762 m2 for the 8 June 2016 sampling date and 0.762 m2 times the subsample fraction for the 29 June 2016 sampling date.  The subsample fraction is defined as the weight of the subsample divided by the weight of the total sample.  The leaves and stems were then placed in an oven and dried at 65 C, and dry weight was measured after the plant material was dry.  The biomass of the stems and leaves on a dry weight basis were calculated from the measured dry weight divided by the land area representative of the processed sample for each sampling date as discussed above for leaf area.  Specific leaf area (for both sample dates) and dry matter fraction (for the June 29 sample date) were also calculated. ","Newcomb, Maria",Field measurements from Maricopa Agricultural Center,2016,
Leaf surface temperature and stomatal conductance estimates using hand-held instruments,"Repeat measurements were taken using hand-held instruments to estimate leaf surface temperatures and leaf stomatal conductance within 6-8 select plots (3-4 accessions x 2 replicates) on 7 dates in mid to late June 2017 (sorghum season 4) as part of a focused field phenotyping campaign related to stomatal regulation.  Leaf surface temperatures were estimated using a FLIR TG167 Spot Thermal Camera (http://www.flir.com/instruments/tg167/) and an Apogee Infrared Radiometer Model MI-230 (https://www.apogeeinstruments.com/ultra-narrow-field-of-view-infrared-radiometer-with-handheld-meter-mi-230/).  Measurements were taken on sunlit leaves, targeting fully expanded when possible, at a distance of approximately 20 to 40 cm above the leaf surface.  Within each plot and at each measurement time, 6 total measurements were taken using the FLIR and Apogee instruments, with 3 measurements taken in each of the West and East subplot rows.  Leaf stomatal conductance was measured using a Decagon SC-1 Porometer (https://www.decagon.com/en/canopy/canopy-measurements/sc-1-leaf-porometer-stomatal-conductance-measurements/).  Within each plot and at each measurement time, 5 total measurements were taken using the porometer, on sunlit leaves targeting fully expanded leaves when possible.  On each of the 7 dates when measurements were taken, early morning baseline equilibrium readings starting at 5:45 to 6:00 for one cycle through all 8 plots.  Mid-day readings started at roughly 11:00 and continued through 3 repeat cycles of the 6-8 plots until roughly 15:00 to 16:00.  The porometer was calibrated at least once in the early morning and again before the mid-day readings.  The FLIR TG167 spot camera was tested against a thermal blackbody unit on 2017-06-21 (recorded 5 readings at 34.5 to 34.6 C while the thermal blackbody recorded 33.9 C).  During the later measurement dates, 2 plots were dropped from the repeat measurement cycles because they had grown out of reach for hand measurements.

Stem elongated internodes and basal tillers counts - visual repeat measures on marked plants,Multiple plants per plot were demarcated in the field early in the season using golf tees placed adjacent to the selected seedlings; numbers of leaves (internodes) were repeatedly counted on the same plant over time by permanently marking each new fully emerged leaf with the leaf number (1 = first leaf to develop) to capture temporal dynamics of growth. Numbers of tillers at each observation early in the season were also counted.

Leaf polyphenolics and chlorophyll measurements: Dualex Scientific+ leaf-clip handheld optical meter,"The optical leaf-clip meter (Dualex Scientific+) uses 5 LED light sources, including 1 UV-A, 1 read and 2 near-infrared (NIR) and a silicon photodiode detector to estimate chlorophyll content in leaves as well as flavonol and anthocyanin contents in the leaf epidermis.  Measurements were taken on sunlit leaves in the upper canopy.  Within each sampled plot, multiple subsample measurements were taken, each on different leaves, targeting fully developed sunlit leaves when possible. The instrument reports 5 measurements:  1) the temperature of the optical emitting head, 2) chlorophyll index (=(NIR trans. - Red trans.)/Red trans), 3) flavonol index (=Log(NIR fluo. excited red/NIR fluo. excited UV-A), 4) anthocyanin index (=Log(NIR fluo. excited red/NIR fluo. excited green), and 5) NBI (proprietary) nitrogen status, Chl/Flav ratio.

LAI estimates using LI-COR handheld LAI-2200C Plant Canopy Analyzer,"The LAI (leaf area index) estimated nondestructively using LAI-2200C Plant Canopy Analyzer(LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) which allows users to operate under full sun condition without further requirements for sun angle. Measurements were conducted along a diagonal transect between the two plant rows of each sampled plot using the 45°view restrictor to hide the user from the sensor Field of View(FOV). Two above-canopy measurements were taken at the beginning and end of the plant rows; five below-canopy measurements were taken along the transect at even spacing by placing the sensor on the ground to assure maximum coverage of the plant canopy in the sensor FOV.",NA,NA,NA,NA
Visual assessment of maturity stage at harvest,"Sorghum growth stage descriptions follow Vanderlip RL. 1993. How a sorghum plant develops. Manhattan, KS, USA: Kansas State University Cooperative Extension. Growth stages grouped by the following categories: vegetative growth prior to flag leaf emergence; flag leaf fully emerged; flowering (anthesis); early, mid, and late grain fill. Numerical categories: 1 = Vegetative; 2 = Flag leaf; 3 = Flowering; 4 = Early grain fill; 5 = Mid grain fill; 6 = Late grain fill.  Early grain fill defined as time from flowering to milk or soft dough stages. Mid grain fill includes soft dough stage. Late grain fill defined as just past soft dough to physiological maturity.

In-season per-plant leaf area and biomass estimates by destructive sampling,"Five plants of median height selected from all plants within 1 meter section of the plot row. The five destructively sampled plants were processed for per-plant leaf area and biomass estimates. All leaves, fully emerged and emerging, were removed from the main stem of each of the five plants and run through leaf area meter to estimate total leaf area per plant (cm2).  Leaves of all five plants were pooled to measure combined leaf fresh weight. Main stems of all five plants were pooled to measure combined stem fresh weight.  Leaf and stem samples were placed in drying oven at 60 C for two days.  Dry weights of leaf and stem samples were measured as the combined weights of all five plants.
